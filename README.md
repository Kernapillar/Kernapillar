ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alex Kern!  
I'm a Cloud/DevOps & Software Engineer with a passion for automation, infrastructure, and building scalable applications. My background spans Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD pipelines, and full-stack development with JavaScript, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, and Python.

Before transitioning into tech, I earned a B.A. in Psychology from UC Santa Cruz and worked in behavioral health and real estate. My interest in programming sparked when I met software engineers while working as a leasing specialist in the Bay Area. A single Python course at my local community college turned into a full-time commitment at App Academy, where I honed my skills in web development, algorithms, and software design.

ðŸ’» My Journey in Tech  
At App Academy, I blended my love for music and programming, developing 4 Block Loop, a JavaScript project that integrates the Tone.js library to create synthesizer and sequencing functionality. Later, I expanded my expertise by building full-stack applications, including:

- Kernify â€“ A full-stack Spotify clone using React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL.
- A MERN stack collaborative drawing platform â€“ A project focused on creative collaboration.

ðŸš€ What I Do Now  
Today, I work as a Cloud/DevOps Engineer, managing Kubernetes clusters, Istio Service Mesh upgrades, and CI/CD pipelines while automating cloud infrastructure using Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins. I also continue to contribute to open-source projects and refine my full-stack development skills.

ðŸ”¥ Always Learning & Growing  
I thrive in fast-paced environments, learning new technologies quickly, and tackling complex engineering challenges. Whether it's optimizing cloud infrastructure, enhancing automation, or developing intuitive web applications, Iâ€™m always excited to build, explore, and innovate.
